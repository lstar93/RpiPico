# RpiPico
Raspberry Pico playground

To make this things work you will need pico-sdk and pico-examples cloned from official Raspberry Pi Pico repository. 

Then you will need export SDK directories i.e.

export PICO_SDK_PATH=/home/RpiPico/pico-sdk/
export PICO_EXAMPLES_PATH=/home/RpiPico/pico-examples
