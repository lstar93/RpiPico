= Attaching a PCA9685 PWM controller via I2C

This example code shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico to the PCA9685 PWM controller. This device uses I2C for communications, and is happy running at either 3.3 or 5v. The Raspberry Pi RP2040 GPIO's work at 3.3v so that is what the example uses.
